# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe in C++

This is a simple **console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game** written in **C++**, built **using functions only**.  
The project demonstrates the use of functions for modular programming in C++.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 2-player game (Player 1 vs Player 2)
- Players can choose their marker (**X** or **0**)  
- Input validation for slots (prevents invalid or already-occupied moves)
- Checks for row, column, and diagonal winners
- Detects tie condition if all slots are filled

---

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- Functions in C++ (`drawBoard`, `placeMarker`, `winner`, `swapPlayerAndMarker`, etc.)
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)
- Loops (`for`, `continue`)
- Arrays (2D array to represent the board)
